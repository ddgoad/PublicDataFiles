Quick summary: If you want to become an NDIS participant you’ll need to apply to the NDIS. There are some requirements you need to meet to be eligible for the NDIS. First, you need to be younger than 65 when you apply, be an Australian citizen or permanent resident, and live in Australia. Then, you’ll need to meet the requirements for disability, early intervention, or both.
You may be eligible under the disability requirements if you have one or more impairments that are or are likely to be permanent. And this substantially impacts your ability to do daily life activities. Your impairment must also affect your social life, or your ability to work and study. And, you must be likely to need NDIS supports for your lifetime. 1 NDIS supports are the services, items and equipment that can be funded by the NDIS.
Or you may be eligible under the early intervention requirements if you have one or more impairments that are likely to be permanent, or you have developmental delay and supports are likely to benefit you by reducing your need for supports in the future. We will also consider if these supports are NDIS supports.
Or you may be eligible under both the disability and early intervention requirements. If you think you might be eligible, we can help you apply to the NDIS. We’ll talk to you about your needs, current situation and what’s important to you. We’ll look at all the information you give us to decide if you’re eligible. If you’re eligible for the NDIS, you’ll become a participant, and we’ll work with you to start creating your plan. If you’re not eligible, an early childhood partner or local area coordinator can help you explore and access government and community services. When we work with children younger than 9 and their families, we call this early connections. When we work with people aged 9–64, we call this community connections.
What do we mean by applying to the NDIS?
Applying to the NDIS means doing things to find out if you can become a participant and start getting supports under the NDIS. There’s a process to follow when you apply to the NDIS. As part of this process, we will need to confirm your identity. Learn more about how to apply to the NDIS.
After you apply, we’ll look at all the information you give us and decide if you’re eligible. If we decide you’re eligible, you’ll become a participant in the NDIS. We’ll then work with you to create your first plan, which will include funding for any reasonable and necessary supports.
If you’re not eligible, there are other services available to you, such as other government and community services. We can help you connect to these other services.
For children younger than 9, we encourage families to talk to an early childhood partner before applying to the NDIS. They can help families connect to the right supports and let families know if the NDIS is right for their child. Learn more about our early childhood approach and early connections.
Are you eligible for the NDIS? To be eligible for the NDIS, you first need to meet the age requirements and residence requirements. This means you need to be younger than 65 when you apply, live in Australia, and be an Australian citizen or permanent resident. 2
You’ll need to meet the requirements for disability 3 , early intervention 4 , or both. When we say impairment in this guideline, we mean a loss of, or damage to your body’s function. Under the law for the NDIS, we check if you’re eligible based on your impairments, not your type of disability or diagnosis.
Disability requirements To meet the disability requirements, we must have evidence of all of the following:
• You have a disability attributable to one or more impairments. This means your
disability and impairments are linked.
• Your impairment is likely to be permanent.
Your impairment means you have a substantially reduced functional capacity to do
one or more daily life activities. These activities include moving around,
communicating, socialising, learning, undertaking self-care, or self-management tasks.
• Your impairment affects your ability to work, study or take part in social life. • You’ll likely need NDIS supports for your lifetime.
Early intervention requirements To meet the early intervention requirements, we must have evidence of all the following:
• You have an impairment that’s likely to be permanent, or that you are a child
younger than 6 with developmental delay.
• Early intervention will benefit you by reducing your need for supports in the future. • Early intervention will benefit you by either reducing the impact your impairment
has on your functional capacity or support your informal supports to build their skills to help you. Or the early intervention will prevent the deterioration of your functional capacity or improve it.
• The early intervention supports you need are NDIS supports. We’ll use information in your application to decide if you’re eligible for the NDIS. If you’re eligible, you become a NDIS participant. 5 The length of time you’ll be a participant will depend on your situation and NDIS support needs. Learn more about leaving the NDIS. This guideline has detailed information on how we decide if you’re eligible for the NDIS. For general information about who’s eligible, read Am I eligible and Applying to the NDIS factsheet. Check out our website for information about children younger than 9. We also have information on psychosocial disability. If you have a psychosocial disability, this webpage has information on whether the NDIS is right for you, and what information we need if you apply.
A psychosocial disability isn’t a mental health condition or diagnosis. A psychosocial disability means you have reduced capacity to undertake tasks and activities of daily living due to your mental health.
Do you meet the age requirements?
To be eligible for the NDIS, you must first meet the age requirements. This means you are younger than 65 on the day you apply.
How old are you? You must be younger than 65 on the day you make your NDIS application. 6 This means your application needs to be complete, in the format we ask for, and received by the NDIA before you turn 65. Learn more about how to complete your NDIS application. If you’re turning 65 soon and want to apply, contact us so we can help you apply on time.
Do you meet the residence requirements?
Then you must meet the residence requirements. This means:
• You are an Australian citizen or permanent resident.
• You live in Australia.
Are you an Australian citizen or permanent resident? You must be an Australian citizen, 7 or have one of two visa types that means you can live here:
• A permanent visa 8 • A protected special category visa 9 – this is only for some citizens of New Zealand.
Do you live in Australia? You must live in Australia. 10 This means Australia is your home and you spend most of your time here.
To help us decide, you need to give us evidence to show us you live here. If you give us consent to use your Centrelink record, that usually gives us enough evidence to decide if you live in Australia.
If you don’t give us consent, you need to give us enough information to help us decide that you live in Australia. You’ll need to answer these questions:
• Where do you live? • Where is your family?
• Do you work in Australia? • Do you own property in Australia? • How much time do you spend outside Australia? Some of these questions might not apply to you, but we must think about them when we decide whether you live in Australia. 11
We may also ask you other questions to determine whether you live in Australia. 12 For example, your family might be deployed overseas in the Defence Force, meaning you need to leave Australia for a while. In these situations, we’ll ask you for more information about why you’re leaving and can’t return.
If you apply, we look at your whole situation when we decide if there’s enough evidence to show that you live here. This will be a simple decision for us in most situations. But sometimes we may need to look at the questions below.
Where do you live? We think about where you live, and your living situation. 13 We’ll look at whether you have more permanent accommodation in Australia than any other country.
For example, you might own a home or have a formal rental agreement in Australia. This is a good sign to us that you live in Australia.
Where is your family? We also think about where your immediate family lives. 14 We look at where you spend most of your time with them, face-to-face. We don’t look at how you connect with your family on the phone or internet.
Do you work in Australia? If you work, we look at where you normally work or make money. 15 If you work or make money in Australia, that’s a good sign you live here. If you don’t work or are unemployed, we’ll consider the other questions to determine whether you live in Australia.
Do you own property in Australia? We look at what assets or property you own in Australia. 16 We also see if you have an Australian bank account.
If you own assets or property here, it doesn’t always mean you live in Australia. Your assets or property will need to show you have an ongoing connection to Australia. You don’t live in Australia just because you own assets or property here.
How much time do you spend outside Australia? We look at how often you go overseas, and how long you’re outside Australia when you travel. 17 We also look at why you travel overseas, such as for work, holiday or to live with family.
This is usually the most important point to help us decide if you live in Australia. You need to show us that you have a long-term and meaningful connection to living in Australia. You don’t need to stay in Australia all the time. You can still work overseas or go on holiday.
You’ll need to show a stronger connection to Australia than other countries if you spend a lot of time overseas.
If we decide you’re eligible and create your plan, there may be times you can’t use your NDIS funding overseas. This is usually after you’re overseas for more than 6 weeks unless we give you more time. Learn more about when you can’t use your plan.
Do you meet the disability requirements? You meet the disability requirements if we have evidence of all the following: 18
• Your disability is caused by an impairment.
• Your impairment is likely to be permanent. • Your permanent impairment substantially reduces your functional capacity to
undertake one or more of the following activities: moving around, communicating, socialising, learning, or undertaking self-care or self-management tasks. • Your permanent impairment affects your ability to work, study or take part in social
life.
• You’ll likely need NDIS support for your lifetime. If you give us evidence you have been diagnosed with one or more conditions on List A, we’ll likely decide you meet the disability requirements.
If you meet the disability requirements, it’s likely you’ll need NDIS supports for your lifetime. This means you won’t have to prove your disability every time we reassess your plan. If at any time your NDIS support needs or situation changes, we may need to check your NDIS eligibility. We will talk with you if this happens.
Learn more about how we check if you are still eligible for the NDIS.
Is your disability related to an impairment? When we think about your disability, we look at whether any reduction or loss in your ability to do things, across all life domains, is because of an impairment.
An impairment is a loss of or damage to your body’s function.
We’ll look at:
• your body’s functions
• your body structure
• how you think and learn.
